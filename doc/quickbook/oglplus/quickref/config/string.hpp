#ifndef OGLPLUS_NO_UTF8_CHECKS /*<
Compile-time switch disabling UTF-8 validity checks in various functions.
Setting this preprocessor symbol to a nonzero value causes that
the __StrLit and __String constructors skip their UTF-8 validity checks.
By default this option is set to the same value as __OGLPLUS_LOW_PROFILE,
i.e. the UTF-8 validity checks are enabled, when not in low-profile mode
and disabled otherwise.
