[section:enums Enumerations]
[/=========================]

[heading oglplus/enumerations.hpp]

OGLplus defines many enumeration types grouping together GL constants
that logically belong together. The strong typing on the enumerations
also prevents in many cases errors like passing invalid constant to
a GL function since the OGLplus function wrappers use appropriate
enumeration types for parameters instead of the generic [^GLenum] type.

[note Many of the GL constant values used in the enumerations are only
available in specific GL versions or with certain GL extensions. If
the underlying GL constant is not defined when the enumeration definition
is processed then the corresponding value is not present in the enumeration.
]

[import enums.hpp]

[heading:functions Functions]

For (almost) all enumeration types the following functions are overloaded.

[oglplus_enums_functions]

[heading:array Enum arrays]

The [^EnumArray] template class is used by several functions as the parameter
type and allows to pass an array of multiple enumerated values to be passed
as an argument.
[note The lifetime of an instance of [^EnumArray] must not exceed the lifetime
of the original array of [^Enum]s from which the [^EnumArray] was initialized.]

[oglplus_enums_EnumArray]

[heading:one_of OneOf]

The [^OneOf] template class is used to merge several enumeration types
into a single type. Instances of [^OneOf] can be implicitly constructed from
a value from any of the merged enumeration types. [^OneOf] is mostly used
as the parameter type in functions that can accept values from multiple
different enumerations.

[note The following definition is just a pseudo-code used for documentation
purposes and differs from the actual implementation of [^OneOf] in certain
aspects. [^OneOf] should not be used in library client code directly,
the only supported operation is construction from an enumeration value.
