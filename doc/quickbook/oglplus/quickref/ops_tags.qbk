[header oglplus/fwd.hpp]

The functions in __OpenGL__ can be divided into several distinct categories
based on how the object that the functions operate on is specified:

# The object is bound to a specific named ['binding point] - ['target]
  and the target identifier is passed as an argument to the function.
  Such functions are referred to as having an ['explicit selector].

# The object is bound to an implicit target (i.e. bound by using the
  appropriate function without any explicit target identifier) and
  the function is called without any targer identifier).
  Such functions are referred to as having an ['implicit selector].

# The object is accessed directly by its unique GL ['name].
  Such functions are referred to as having ['direct state access].

In some cases (for example if the
[@http://www.opengl.org/registry/specs/EXT/direct_state_access.txt
[^EXT_direct_state_access] extension] is implemented) there
are several functions implementing the same operation, but differing
in the way how the object that they operate on in selected.

__OGLplus__ distinguishes the categories or kinds of the functions
as listed above at compile-time by using the following tag types:

[import ops_tags.hpp]
[oglplus_ops_tags]
