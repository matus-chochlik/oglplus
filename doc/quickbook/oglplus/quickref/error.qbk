[section:error Error reporting and handling]
[/=========================================]

In order to detect and report any errors that occured during the calls
to OpenGL functions, OGLplus consistently checks the result of the [glfunc GetError]
function and if an error is indicated it throws an instance of an appropriate exception
class. The exceptions (described below) contain a lot of useful information about
the error and are highly configurable. In debug builds all available information
about the errors can be included, on the other hand when high performance is required
most of the data members can be compiled-away by setting the appropriate
[link oglplus.quickref.config.error compile-time configuration options] making
the exceptions more lightweight.
