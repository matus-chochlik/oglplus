[heading:size Size]

The [^BufferSize] class is used to store GPU buffer sizes in units of machine byte.
Instances of this class are mostly used as parameters to buffer-related functions
specifying buffer data offset and size.

[header oglplus/buffer_size.hpp]
[import buffer_size.hpp]
[oglplus_buffer_size]

The [^BufferTypedSize] template class is a helper ancestor of [^BufferSize]
that is used to construct instances of [^BufferSize] with fixed data type.

[oglplus_buffer_typed_size]

[heading:data Data]

The [^BufferData] class is used to store a pointer to and the size of a block
of memory containing data to be uploaded to a GPU buffer.
Instances of this class are mostly used as parameters to buffer-related functions
specifying buffer data to be uploaded to the GPU's memory.

[note This class does not do an internal deep copy of the data passed to the constructors.
The original memory block must not be free'd while any instances of [^BufferData]
referencing it are in use.

[heading:gpu_address GPU address]

The [^BufferGPUAddress] class encapsulates buffers GPU address value.
