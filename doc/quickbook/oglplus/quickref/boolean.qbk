[heading oglplus/boolean.hpp]

OGLplus defines a wrapper for ['boolean] values represented in
OpenGL, OpenAL, etc. by integer types with wider than one-bit range.

Instances of this type are implicitly constructible from and convertible to
[^bool] values and also explicitly constructible from values of the underlying
type (like [^GLint], [^ALint], [^EGLBoolean], etc.)
Instances of [^Boolean] can be in three states: [^true], [^false] and ['indeterminate],
(i.e. [*both] the [^operator bool] and [^operator !] can return [^false] for some
instances).
