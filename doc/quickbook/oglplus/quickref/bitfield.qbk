[header oglplus/bitfield.hpp]

The [^Bitfield] template serves as a wrapper for OpenGL bitfields. It allows to combine
strongly-typed enumerated values into a single bitfield value.

Library end-user applications rarely need to use this class directly.
Instantiations of this template are used as types for parameters in functions
taking bitfields based on strongly-type enumerations. When constructing a bitfield
the application simply passes the enumerated value or a combination of enumerated
values using the bitwise-or operator or initializer list.
