[header oglplus/object/desc.hpp]

Objects with OpenGL names (unsigned integers) can optionally have a textual
description. This is useful for diagnostic purposes, for example in an application
with lots of different shaders it is easier to track the source of compilation,
linking or validation errors when the individual shader or program objects
have a human-readable description which is attached to the exception raised
by the error.

The descriptions are assigned to objects by using the __ObjectDesc class.
